 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Dataset
 🧠 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my **HexSoftwares Data Science Internship**.  
The goal was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the COVID-19 dataset to uncover insights about case trends, recovery rates, and fatalities across countries.


 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the COVID-19 dataset for trends and patterns  
- Identify missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies  
- Visualize key relationships between features  
- Extract actionable insights to understand the pandemic impact

 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Language:** Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Platform: Visual Studio Code  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub  

 📈 Project Process
1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Handle missing values and clean the data  
3. Perform statistical analysis  
4. Visualize data trends, correlations, and distributions  
5. Summarize insights and conclusions  

🔍 Key Findings
- The highest surge in cases occurred during mid-2020, with regional variations.  
- Countries with higher testing rates showed lower fatality ratios.  
- Recovery rates improved steadily as vaccination programs were implemented.  

 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened skills in **data cleaning and preprocessing**  
- Gained experience in **data visualization and interpretation**  
- Learned to extract meaningful insights from real-world datasets  
- Improved proficiency in **Python libraries for data analysis**
